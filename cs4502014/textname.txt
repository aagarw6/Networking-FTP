I am a travel fanatic,a reading buff,a groovy designer and a coder by choice. Books are my friends, music is my oxygen and I love eating different cuisines. I love socializing and follow different social sites. I am searching an opportunity where I can become a part of a team with crackling ideals and humble working environment. I love sports like biking, basketball and cricket. I have been coding in C++ and Java for six years now. I found Snapchat a very funky idea to remain connected to my friends all over the world and will love to be a part of an enterprise where "the soul reason is connection". I believe its important to be connected and network with people.You guys make it more than fun. In Peace , looking forward to your reply.
